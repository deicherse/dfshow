DF-SHOW
=======

DF-SHOW (Directory File Show) is a POSIX rewrite of the SHOW application from Larry Kroeker's DF-EDIT (Directory File Editor) based on the Version 2.3b release from 1986.

The show application lets users view the names of files and directories on a disk with information about the files. Files can be copied, moved, viewed, and edited (in your system's default editor). The application is run using the `show` command. The output is similar to the `ls` command.
